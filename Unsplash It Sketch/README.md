# Unsplash It Sketch Plugin

![Unsplash It Sketch Plugin Icon](/assets/icon_small.png?raw=true "Unsplash It Sketch Plugin Icon")

A plugin to quickly include great looking images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) in your Sketch projects.
Because being able to quickly iterate on UI is important but also having great photography as placeholders is not that bad.


## Demo

### Updates
*1.3*
- Switched to the Unsplash Source API.
- You can now specify tags, between square brackets, in the layer name. ( e.g. [bird, sea] ). If no image is available for the search tags you choose, you get a default image with "We coulnd' find that photo" on it.
- Removed options, since to blur and desaturate the image is fairly easy to do using default Sketch tools.

### Next iteration
- With the layer selected, being able to navigate to the picture page URL on Unsplash.


## Installation
#### With Sketch Toolbox
1. Look for "Unsplash It" in Sketch Toolbox
2. Click on "Install"

#### Manual
1. Download Zip and Extract it to a folder
2. In Sketch app Plugins > Reveal Plugins folder...
3. Place the extracted folder directly to the Plugins folder


## Usage

1. Create one or more shapes and select them
2. Run the plugin from the plugins menu or you can use the shortcut cmd + shift + u
3. That's it, your shape(s) will become beautiful placeholder images

#### optional
Name your layer according to the content of the image you need, using tags in square brackets. e.g. a layer named "Rectanlge [food]" would only fill with images of food.
