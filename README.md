# My Sketch Plugins

A list of some of the plugins I use daily with [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com).

## To get the plugins, open your terminal app and paste the following code.

	$ cd Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins
	
	$ git clone https://github.com/orlanmarty/SketchSetup.git	

## For updates, do the following.
